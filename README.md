# Sentiment-Analysis
VADER-Sentiment Analysis through NLP
----------------------------------------------------------------
#####  NLP(Natural Language Processing):
Natural Language Processing or NLP is a field of Artificial Intelligence that gives the machinesthe ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages.Basically,VADER(Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.
### Working of this Application :
Firstly the Application is Command line based executable under Python Environment and
uses popular Python Libraries such as nltk and vaderSentiment ,Initially a Quiz type interface is created based on the answers provide by the user it decides the approximate emotion or sentiment of user therby recommends the songs in accordance with the compund score generated after the quiz,this can be further extended to playlist recommendations as per the user by performing supervised learning.

##### Basically This project comprises of Three Modules :
* Index (Sentiment-Analysis)
* Playlist
* Quotes


### Software Requirements:
* #####  Jupyter NoteBook 
* ##### Install Python Libraries as follows ,
 Run the these Commands in the JupyterNotebook or in Python Environment:

* For NLTK(Natural Language ToolKit) -A Popular Library run the below command as follows:
>                                           pip install -U nltk
* For Sentiment Analysis,importing vadersentiment is required thus run the command as follows:
>                                         pip install vaderSentiment

*  After installing above libraries,we need to import those and use the functionality in this application.More features are yet to be included in this project using Unsupervised Learning
